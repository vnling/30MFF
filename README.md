# What People Do

For this assignment, our task was to create a website to display and "tell the story" of a film we created in thirty minutes. 

## Concept and Theme

The film created by my group, titled What People Do, is a reflection on our everyday activities in quarantine. We wanted to use this creative opportunity to reflect on the beauty that remains in life and the human experience. We chose to underlay the film with an upbeat soundtrack to echo the optimism seen in our footage, and to convey our hopes for the future. Consequently, I wanted to create a site that would reinforce the message of our film. I settled on a bright and bubbly (literally) concept, aiming to create a site that prioritizes intuitive navigation and interactivity.
